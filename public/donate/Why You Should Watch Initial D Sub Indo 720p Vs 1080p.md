## What is 720p and 1080p?
 
720p and 1080p are terms that refer to the resolution of a video. Resolution is the number of pixels that make up an image on a screen. The higher the resolution, the more pixels there are, and the sharper and clearer the image will be.
 
720p means that the video has a resolution of 1280 x 720 pixels, which is equivalent to high-definition (HD) quality. 1080p means that the video has a resolution of 1920 x 1080 pixels, which is equivalent to full high-definition (FHD) quality.
 
Generally speaking, higher resolution videos offer better quality and detail than lower resolution videos. However, higher resolution videos also require more bandwidth and storage space than lower resolution videos. Therefore, higher resolution videos may not be compatible with some devices or internet connections.
